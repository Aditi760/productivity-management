Productivity-management is a **Chrome extension** to help people and analyze their productivity. It offers a suite of time management tools that track your work and break times, reminding you when it's time to get up and move around or get back to work.
# Features
* **Timer** -you can set a time for how long you want to work on that tab and it’ll remind you when the time is up.

* **Manage your To-do-list** - you can create a list of tasks to perform and mark it complete when it’s done
* **Block Site**- It improves your productivity by blocking access to time-consuming websites (like during working hours) as you specify in Options. Block Site is by default disabled and doesn't block any website until you say so in Options
* **Alarm** - one can set an alarm or reminder for tasks, and it will remind them of the task
* **Track of time** - Ever open an email, do a task, then wonder how long that took? then just look at this. It records how long it's been since the URL has changed
